# Streaming sensor data from Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to the no-code platform Tulip using Thonny IDE, MQTT Explorer and Node-RED

As of 06.02.2022, I am still working on this README file.

Written by Ismet Catovic. Credits to Divya Kara who has done a similar project using MQTT, Node-Red and InfluxDB to stream sensor data to Grafana. Click [here](https://github.com/divyakara/VM-IoT) for more details of Divya's project.

This project is about connecting the sensors to Tulip.

## Project overview

The purpose of this project is to explain how to set up two HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors using the MicroPython firmware. Moreover, I will explain how to send data from the sensor to Node-RED and Tulip.

### Materials

Figure 1 shows the breadboard where one motherbard is going to be placed. The first sensor uses the ESP32 device from AZ-Delivery (Fig. 2) and the other sensor uses the Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 motherboard (Fig 3). Figure 4 shows how the sensor looks like.

Each sensor and motherboard is using separate breadboards.

### Environment setup

The following were used when setting up the environment for the two sensors:

- Python (latest version)
- Thonny IDE: A beginner-friendly Python editor. Download it [here](https://thonny.org/)
  - NOTE! Two instances of this IDE are required in order for both sensors to work simultaneously. When installing the IDE and running it, enter Tools > Options >          General, then unmark Allow only single Thonny Instance.
- Edge I/O: A Tulip compatible edge device required for sending data between Tulip and Thonny using Node-RED.
- Tulip Platform: A no-code platform that receives data from the Node-RED diagram created through the Edge IO.
- Node-RED: A flow diagram that sends data from Thonny to Tulip using the MQTT.
  - Node-RED can be accessed by selecting one of the Edge Devices by their IP address available in your local Tulip instance. When entering the menu of the Edge I/O,       click on the Node-RED editor link.


## Instructions

Below are instructions how to setup the two scanners using different motherboards.

Each Thonny IDE instance will have a different intepreter.

### Setting up the sensor using ESP32

1. Setup the motherboard on the breadboard according to the circuit diagram below.

![Circuit Diagram AZ-Delivery ESP32-WROOM-32 jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62876523/215798947-b83b623d-9e07-45c1-a751-db97a09bbacb.jpg)

2. Install esptool.py and setuptools by entering the following commands in the command prompt (sometimes you need to access it as an Admin):
```
pip install esptool
pip install setuptools
python -m esptool
```

3. Connect the motherboard to your computer using a USB-C cable. A red light on the motherboard should turn on if properly connected. Find and remember which COM port is used by opening the device manager on Windows. (see Ports)

NOTE! If the port is not detected and is unknown, download the USB serial driver [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads). Unzip the downloaded file, enter the device manager and find the COM port that is unknown. Update the driver by browsing your computer for drivers and select the CP2012 folder that you have unzipped. The name of the Silicon Valley driver should appear.

4. Download the latest version of MicroPython from https://micropython.org/download/#esp32. Select ESP32 by Espressif and download the latest .bin release.

5. Open Thonny IDE options and enter the Interpreter section. Select MicroPython (ESP32) as the interpreter and select Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COMx) as the port.

6. Before pressing OK in the Thonny Options window, click on "Install or update MicroPython" and select the same port you have chosen on the previous step. The firmware is the .bin file downloaded on step 4. Then, select From image file (Keep) as the flash mode and check "Erase flash before installing." Press Install, this process may take a minute. When the installation is done, leave the window and press OK. You are now configuring the motherboard om COMx.

7. Copy the following HC-SR04 MicroPython Library into a file in Thonny and save the script with the name hcsr04.py to the MicroPython device. The library can be found under https://github.com/rsc1975/micropython-hcsr04 and is not part of the standard MicroPython library by default. It is recommended to save the library under a separate folder, in case the COM port of any motherboards changes when reconnecting the motherboards to different USB ports.

        cms = (pulse_time / 2) / 29.1
        return cms

```

8. Create a new script with the name sensor1.py. Import the following libraries:
```
from machine import Pin, I2C
from hcsr04 import HCSR04
from time import sleep
import dht
import network
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient
```
9. Add the following connect_wifi function to the script in order to enable connection to the router.

```
def connect_wifi(ssid, password):   

#connect to wifi
  wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
  wlan.active(True)
  if not wlan.isconnected():
    print('connecting to network...')
    wlan.connect(ssid, password)
    while not wlan.isconnected():
        pass
  print('Network config:', wlan.ifconfig())
  print('Connected to ', ssid)
```
Remember to use the def by entering its parameters. The ssid is the name of the WLAN.

10. Connect to the broker by assigning CLIENT_NAME to the broker where the data should be sent. The BROKER_ADDR is assigned to the IP address of the Tulip edge device. When done, define the topics. Use the code below for help.

```
CLIENT_NAME = '080 Tulip/Work Instructions and TAKT/ESP32/Sensor1'
BROKER_ADDR = '172.16.2.7'
mqttc = MQTTClient(CLIENT_NAME, BROKER_ADDR, keepalive=60)
mqttc.connect()

#Topics
BTN_TOPIC_DIST = CLIENT_NAME.encode() + b'/distance'
```

11. Define the sensor by using the HCSR04 class available in hcsr04.py. Set the trigger_pin and the echo_pin according to the circuit diagram.

```
sensor = HCSR04(trigger_pin=5, echo_pin=18, echo_timeout_us=10000)

graph = ""
timerCount = 0
```

12. Copy the code below which runs the sensor and measure its distance.

```
while True:
    try:
      timerCount += 0.5;
      
      # The distance is printed out on the shell terminal each 0.5 seconds
      sleep(0.5)
      distance = sensor.distance_mm(),
      print('Distance:', distance, 'mm')
      print(timerCount)
      
      # Publish the distances on MQTT. The outputs are represented using the MQTT Explorer.
      mqttc.publish( BTN_TOPIC_DIST, (str(distance).encode()) )
    except OSError as e:
        print("FAILED")
```

13. Save the file as a sensor1.py script and run it. If the sensor works properly, the distance will vary for each half second.

#### MQTT Explorer (Keep the sensor1.py script running in Thonny while configuring MQTT Explorer)

14. Download MQTT Explorer [here.](http://mqtt-explorer.com/)

15. When opening the MQTT Explorer, add a connection and name it as you want. Use the mqtt:// as a protocol and the 172.16.2.7 as the broker. Use any port you want, I have used port 1883. Save the connection and then press connect. You will receive data from the script running (I will add a picture here.)

#### Tulip

16. Enter the Machines section in Tulip. If desired, create a new machine type where the machines that you will create are related to the sensors you have setted up.

17. Go the machine type where the machines will be created and add a machine attribute that is related to the distance from the sensor. The data type should be a number.

18. Return to the Machines section and create a machine that belongs to the machine type where the sensors will be stored. When the machine is created, map the machine attribute you have created for the sensor to the Tulip API data source. (Select a machine > Configuration > Attributes Unmapped).

19. A JSON object that has a machine ID and an attribute ID should appear when the attribute has been mapped to the Tulip API. Copy and save the JSON object somewhere as the object will be used when defining the "tulip-machine-attribute" node in Node-RED.

#### Node-RED

20. Access the edge device by its local IP address.

21. Create a Node-RED flow diagram according to the one below. (Picture is missing)

22. If the Node-RED diagram is correct, it should receive data from the topic specified in the "mqqt in" node. 

### Setting up the sensor using ESP8266 (Pictures will come later)

1. Setup the motherboard according to the circuit diagram below.

![Circuit Diagram Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62876523/215798813-8faaef98-5c49-42ef-a10f-ff2121305566.jpg)

Check the manual on the following link if you are unsure which GPIO number is corresponding to each pin of the motherboard: https://www.kjell.com/globalassets/mediaassets/855793_87294_datasheet_en.pdf?ref=2AEAD8250F

2. Install esptool.py and setuptools by entering the following commands
```
pip install esptool
pip install setuptools
python -m esptool
```

3. Enter Device Manager and see if the motherboard has been properly connected. USB-SERIAL CH340 should be shown under the Ports section.

4. Download the latest .bin release version of MicroPython [here.](https://micropython.org/download/esp8266-1m/) (ESP8266 with 1 MiB flash)

5. Open Thonny IDE options and enter the Interpreter section. Select MicroPython (ESP8266) as the interpreter and select USB-SERIAL CH340 (COMx) as the port.

6. Before pressing OK in the Thonny Options window, click on "Install or update MicroPython" and select the same port you have chosen on the previous step. The firmware is the .bin file downloaded on step 4. Then, select From image file (Keep) as the flash mode and check "Erase flash before installing." Press Install, this process may take a minute. When the installation is done, leave the window and press OK. You are now configuring the motherboard om COMx.

7. Copy the following HC-SR04 MicroPython Library into a file in Thonny and save the script with the name hcsr04.py to the MicroPython device. The library can be found under https://github.com/rsc1975/micropython-hcsr04 and is not part of the standard MicroPython library by default. It is recommended to save the library under a separate folder, in case the COM port of any motherboards changes when reconnecting the motherboards to different USB ports.

8. Create a new script with the name sensor2.py. Import the following libraries:
```
from machine import Pin, I2C
from hcsr04 import HCSR04
from time import sleep
import dht
import network
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient

```

13. Save the file as a sensor2.py script and run it. If the sensor works properly, the distance will vary for each half second.

#### MQTT Explorer (Keep the sensor2.py script running in Thonny while configuring MQTT Explorer)

14. Download MQTT Explorer [here.](http://mqtt-explorer.com/)

15. When opening the MQTT Explorer, add a connection and name it as you want. Use the mqtt:// as a protocol and the 172.16.2.7 as the broker. Use any port you want, I have used port 1883. Save the connection and then press connect. You will receive data from the script running, see picture below.

![MQTT Explorer Stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62876523/216610301-b1a4634d-b755-41c3-b263-a0908907198c.PNG)

#### Tulip

16. Enter the Machines section in Tulip. If desired, create a new machine type where the machines that you will create are related to the sensors you have setted up.

17. Go the machine type where the machines will be created and add a machine attribute that is related to the distance from the sensor. The data type should be a number.

18. Return to the Machines section and create a machine that belongs to the machine type where the sensors will be stored. When the machine is created, map the machine attribute you have created for the sensor to the Tulip API data source. (Select a machine > Configuration > Attributes Unmapped).

19. A JSON object that has a machine ID and an attribute ID should appear when the attribute has been mapped to the Tulip API. Copy and save the JSON object somewhere as the object will be used when defining the "tulip-machine-attribute" node in Node-RED.

#### Node-RED

20. Access the edge device by its local IP address.

21. Create a Node-RED flow diagram according to the one below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62876523/216608318-736178f7-5ade-43c1-9585-016bf7ed714c.png)

The diagram needs the following:
- A "debug" node, also known as the msg.payload node. This is the actual intended message.
- A "mqtt in" node, which fetches the data from the topic in MQTT. Connect the node with "debug". Then, go to Properties by double-clicking the same node.
  - Copy the topic where the sensor data is visualized and paste it into the Topic attribute.
  - The server is a MQTT one.
  - The output is a parsed JSON object.
  - Naming it is optional, but name it Sensor 2 Distance (ESP8266).
 - A "change" node, in order to convert the payload from a JSON object to a number. Connect the node with "mqtt in".
  - Set the data type of "msg.payload" to a number.
 - A "tulip-machine-attribute" node, which will act as the Tulip API which is mapped to the attribute you have created under "Machines" in Tulip. Connect the node with "mqtt in".
   - Copy-paste the mapped JSON attribute you have saved into "Device info". Rename the attribute to the same name as in the machine attribute in Tulip.
   - Use EDIT ME as a custom authentication.
   - Use "msg.payload" as an attribute source.

### Testing

22. Deploy the changes you have done in Node-RED. Make sure the sensor2.py script is running. If set up correctly and according to step 21, you should see that the machine attribute for Sensor 2 machine receives data. 

23. When Tulip is receiving data from Node-RED, you are ready to use the same data when developing various apps in Tulip!
